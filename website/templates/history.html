    <h1>the history of fashion</h1>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">ancient civilizations (2700 BCE)</h2>
        <p>In ancient civilizations, clothing was shaped by climate, resources, and status. 
            In Egypt, light linen garments such as kilts and sheath dresses suited the desert heat, while elaborate jewelry and wigs signified rank. 
            Ancient Greece favored draped, body-conscious styles like chitons and himations, reflecting their admiration for the human form. 
            Rome brought structured tunics and the iconic toga, symbolizing citizenship and class. 
            Meanwhile, in Asia, China developed silk production as early as 2700 BCE, with the hanfu becoming a cultural staple. 
            In India, early sari-like garments were common, while Japan laid the foundations for the kimono.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">medieval period (500-1400 CE)</h2>
        <p>During the medieval period, fashion in Europe became more layered and class-based. 
            Most people wore simple tunics, but the nobility embraced richer fabrics, embroidery, and tighter tailoring as time passed. 
            Sumptuary laws controlled who could wear certain colors or materials, reinforcing the divide between the elite and the working class.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">the renaissance (1400-1600)</h2>
        <p>The Renaissance ushered in a vibrant and artistic era of fashion. 
            Italian and Spanish courts led the way with elaborate silhouettes—think puffed sleeves, corsets, and slashed fabrics.
            Fashion became a way to display wealth and refinement, with increased attention to detail, textiles, and shape.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">baroque and rococo fashion (1600-1790)</h2>
        <p>Baroque and Rococo fashion brought theatrical elegance to European wardrobes. 
            The Baroque period favored heavy, dramatic fabrics, lace, and grand silhouettes. 
            King Louis XIV of France became a global fashion icon. 
            In the Rococo era, styles lightened, and pastel colors, pannier skirts, and powdered wigs became fashionable among the aristocracy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">the late 18th and early 19th centuries</h2>
        <p>Following the French Revolution, fashion took a sharp turn toward simplicity. 
            The late 18th and early 19th centuries embraced neoclassical influence: high-waisted dresses in flowing white fabric for women, and tailored coats, breeches, and cravats for men. 
            The Regency period introduced the prototype of modern menswear with clean-cut silhouettes and dark colors.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">the victorian era (1830-1900)</h2>
        <p>The Victorian era was defined by formality and structure. 
            Women's fashion included tight corsets, crinolines, bustles, and elaborate gowns. 
            Industrialization brought mass-produced clothing, making fashion more accessible. Men’s fashion became standardized with three-piece suits, pocket watches, and bowler hats.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">the early 20th century</h2>
        <p>The early 20th century brought rapid changes. 
            Edwardian women adopted the "Gibson Girl" look—corseted but athletic. During World War I, fashion became more practical, and women began wearing trousers. 
            The 1920s exploded with rebellion and glamour: flapper dresses, bobbed hair, and jazz culture defined the decade. 
            In the 1930s and 1940s, Hollywood glamour and tailored suits prevailed, while World War II brought rationing and a utilitarian look.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">post-war fashion (1945-1970)</h2>
        <p>Post-war fashion (1945-1970) revived luxury and femininity. 
            Christian Dior's “New Look” in 1947 reintroduced full skirts and hourglass shapes. 
            The 1950s favored conservative styles and polished elegance, while the 1960s broke boundaries with miniskirts, mod fashion, and psychedelic prints. 
            The hippie movement embraced natural fabrics, ethnic influence, and handmade styles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">1970s to 2000</h2>
        <p>From the 1970s to 2000, fashion became increasingly diverse and expressive. 
            The '70s brought bell-bottoms, disco styles, and punk rebellion. 
            The 1980s were bold, with shoulder pads, power suits, and bright colors defining the era. 
            Designers like Versace and Mugler pushed boundaries with glamorous, provocative looks. 
            In the '90s, fashion took a more relaxed turn with grunge, minimalism, and the rise of supermodels. 
            Streetwear brands like Stüssy and Supreme emerged during this time.</p>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">21st century</h2>
        <p>In the 21st century, fashion has become global, fast-paced, and digital. 
            The 2000s embraced flashy trends, low-rise jeans, and logo-heavy designs, while the 2010s shifted toward minimalism and normcore. 
            Streetwear exploded in popularity, with luxury collaborations redefining high fashion. Sustainability, inclusivity, and technology now lead the conversation. 
            Virtual fashion, AI-generated clothing, and digital runways are reshaping the industry.</p>
