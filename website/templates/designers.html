    <h1>the evolution of fashion</h1>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">origins (pre-1800s)</h2>
        <p>Fashion began as functional clothing in ancient civilizations, with early examples like Egyptian linen tunics (3000 BCE) and Roman togas. The concept of "fashion" as we know it emerged in 14th century Europe, when tailored garments replaced draped fabrics and styles began changing seasonally.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">industrial revolution (1800-1900)</h2>
        <p>The sewing machine (1846) and mass production transformed fashion from handmade to industrialized. Charles Worth established haute couture in Paris (1858), creating seasonal collections for clients. Women's fashion featured crinolines and bustles, while men adopted the modern suit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">modernism (1900-1950)</h2>
        <p>Coco Chanel liberated women from corsets in the 1920s with simple jersey dresses. World War II brought fabric rationing and utilitarian styles. Christian Dior's 1947 "New Look" reintroduced luxury with cinched waists and full skirts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">cultural revolutions (1960-1990)</h2>
        <p>Youth culture exploded with Mary Quant's miniskirts (1964) and hippie styles. Japanese designers like Yohji Yamamoto (1981) deconstructed Western fashion. The 1990s saw grunge (Marc Jacobs for Perry Ellis, 1992) and minimalist chic (Calvin Klein).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2 class="era-title">digital age (2000-present)</h2>
        <p>Fast fashion (Zara, H&M) and social media accelerated trends. Virgil Abloh's Off-White (2012) blended streetwear and luxury. Today, sustainability and digital fashion (NFTs, virtual try-ons) are reshaping the industry.</p>
